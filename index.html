                    <h3>Train your own model</h3>
                    <p>This feature allows users to train their custom machine learning models using their own datasets or add and expand to the existing datasets. Users can upload their data, label it accordingly, and train a model tailored to their specific needs. This empowers users to create models that are highly specialized and optimized for their unique requirements.</p>

                    <p>With this feature, users can easily upload images of plants or affected areas to the platform. The system supports various image formats and provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images from different devices such as smartphones, tablets, or computers. Once uploaded, these images can be analyzed and processed to detect signs of plant diseases or other relevant information.</p>

                    <p>This feature leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze uploaded images and accurately predict plant diseases or health conditions. By processing the uploaded images, the system identifies patterns, symptoms, and characteristic markers associated with various plant diseases.</p>

                    <h3>Project Inspiration</h3>
                    <p>During my time at ALX Africa and Holberton School, I encountered numerous challenges in identifying plant diseases effectively. Witnessing the detrimental effects of undetected diseases on crop yields and farmers' livelihoods sparked a personal passion within me to develop a solution. Inspired by my experiences and driven by the desire to contribute to sustainable agriculture, I embarked on the journey of creating InBloom.</p>
                    <p>This project is more than just a requirement, it embodies my commitment to leveraging technology for social good. From the initial idea to its realization, the project timeline reflects my dedication to learning and applying cutting-edge technologies. InBloom serves as a testament to my growth and skills gained through ALX Africa and Holberton School.</p>
